# Milestone Project II: Interactive Memory Game
This project aims to showcase my skills in JS and jQuery by creating an interactive memory game. The game is simple in concept but allows for varying difficulties and live score updates.

## UX
The page has a simple web structure that stays consistent across mobile and desktop devices. The tiles will play a flip animation as users make their choice. Javascript will also be used here. Javascript will also be ued here to ensure users have time enough
to view their selection whilst disabling users from making other selections and leading into game-breaking scenraios.

## User Stories
As a user, I would like to have fun playing this memory game.
* This will be achieved by allowing users to see their progress through visual cues such as tiles disappearing and fading after being chosen correctly and by live score updates.

## Features
### Load In
* The page will only render images after the are all ready to be displayed. This should stop users from seeing 'behind' tiles before the game starts.

### Flip animation
* The flip animation after selection adds more interactivity to the page. This visually appealing motion should also help retains user attention.

### Difficulties
* By including separate difficulties, users will be more engaged to come back to the site and try to beat their previous score on each and every difficulty.

## Features left to Implement

## Technologies used
### [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/)
HTML was used for the basic structure

### [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
CSS was used to style my page

### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Bootsrap was used for its responsivity and mobile first design

### [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
The Font Awesome library was used for it rich text icons

### [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/) and [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
Javascript and jQuery was used for its ability to transverse and manipulate the DOM, thus incorparating interactivity into my website.

## Testing
.

## Deployment
My project has been deployed to gitpages using the following procedure:
* Opening github and going to 'settings' tab on my page.
* Scrolling down to the 'Github Pages' selection
* Under 'Source' 2 options are available:
 * 'master' was chosen for the Branch option and 'root' was chosen for the Folder section.
 * My site has now been deployed to [https://futhimhlas.github.io/memoryGame/](https://futhimhlas.github.io/memoryGame/)

 Cloning my repository can be done by downloading the ZIP or by using the HTTPS URL.
 * First open a repository you'd like to copy into.
 * In your workspace terminal use the command 'git clone' + the https url of my site (https://github.com/futhimhlas/memoryGame.git).
 * So your command would look like this 'git clone https://github.com/futhimhlas/memoryGame.git' followed by enter
